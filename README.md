# Workshop template

## 1. Get it!

**Don't fork it**.

1. Download it as a [ZIP Archive](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/workshop-template/archive/master.zip)
2. Create a new repo from its content

## Edit it!

The content is located in `public/content.md`.

You just have to follow its conventions:

* `#` for title, `##` for subtitle
* The first `####` and content below will be displayed as an introduction.
* All the following `####` and content will be displayed as a card, and their titles automagically added to the left nav menu.

## Deploy it!

That's about it folks!
